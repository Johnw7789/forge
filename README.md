# About this project

Forge is an advanced account generator and toolkit that uses various bot evasion techniques to bypass restrictions on making accounts. Not a single automated browser is used, all automation is done through http requests using a matching user-agent and tls fingerprint combination along with proper header order. 

# Technologies used

Forge was built using Go for the backend, React for the frontend, and ![Wails](https://wails.io/).
